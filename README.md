# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

IMPORTANT: Loading glTF models into a Three.js scene is a lot of work.
 * Before we can configure or animate our model’s meshes, we need to iterate through
 * each part of our model’s meshes and save them separately.
 * For this model, visit https://gltf.pmnd.rs/
